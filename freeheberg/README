DESCRIPTION:

    What is OpenUpload?

    It is a php web application to handle a files upload/download service.
    It aims to be customizable/extendible.
    It can be used inside enterprises for sharing files fast with customers.


INSTALLATION:
 
    See INSTALL file for details.


REPORTING BUGS / FEATURE REQUESTS / JOIN DEVELOPMENT:

    There is a mailing list which can be used to report bugs and feature requests.
    (see web site for detail)
    I'd really apreciate any feedback.
    The traker is also a good place to report bugs.
    Ho, and would really love to have somebody else work on the project.


TRANSLATIONS:

    Right now the program is only translated to Italian and French
    Translating isn't that hard (at least the default template)
    I have implemented 2 tranlsation modules, but there is a tool which converts from 
    one to the other (from gettext to php).
    Right now you can choose to translate with a php array, or use gettext tools (like poedit), to 
    translate the app to your language. Gettext tools are much easier to use.
    It's divided in 2 parts. 1 is for the application, and 1 is for the template.
    They are located in locale/* for the application and templates/default/locale for the 2nd.
    Once your translation is ready please send it to me or on the ML.
