INTRODUCTION

    This document describes the basic steps to install Open Upload.
    Be sure to also read README file.
    In this document there is also some documentation I suggest you to read.

INDEX

    * Requirements
    * Quick Start
    * Modes and Rights
    * LDAP Authentication  
    * Multisite installation
    * IP Blocking Feature
    * Templates / Logo change

             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS

    To be able to use this software you need:
    - A running Web Server with PHP 5.x (version 4 won't work)
    - Database (MySQL / PostgreSql) (optional but raccomended)
    - PHP and Web server must be configured to allow the file uploads
      More specifically:
        by default php allows uploads of max 2Mb file size. 
        You'll need to update the php.ini file to allow the maximum allowed size of your site, either by modifying the php.ini or
        allowing Apache (or the web server) to let .htaccess override the limit. (i.e. AllowOverride Options)
        In the www directory there is an example .htaccess file
    - PHP must be installed with the DATABASE backend you want to use,
      and GD image extensions for captcha to work.
    - Also the LDAP extension needs to be installed if you plan to use 
      LDAP/AD Authentcation.

             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICK START

    * BIG FAT NOTE: This procedure is aimed to let you test the program functionality.
                    Once this program is right for you read the MULTISITE INSTALLATION to avoid
                    security issues.
                    You should make sure the files other than "www" are not directly accessible via WEB
                    More specifically this are the most important:
                       "data" directory where files are stored
                       "txtdb" if a flat txt database is used

    * Download the source from http:/www.sf.net/projects/openupload
    * Untar the file 
       tar xzf <release>.tar.gz
    * Copy all files to somewhere which is accessible from the web (i.e. /var/www/html/openupload)
    * Point your browser to where the application has been installed (i.e. http://localhost/openupload)
    * Follow the setup steps.

MANUAL CONFIGURATION

    * Copy the www/config.inc.php.example and edit it to suit your installation
    * Make sure the web server is able to write to the "data", "data/tmp" and "templates_c" directory
    * Create the database 
       ( see MODES AND RIGHTS for more information on mode and rights configuration)
       MYSQL: 
         - create the db and the user
           create database <database>;
           grant all privileges on <database>.* to '<user>'@'localhost' ideintified by '<password>';
         - import the database schema and default config options
           mysql <database> -u <user> -p < sql/mysql/1_schema.sql
           mysql <database> -u <user> -p < sql/mysql/2_base.sql
         - import the configuration mode (it is not required):
           mysql <database> -u <user> -p < sql/mysql/3_mode_<selected>.sql
       PGSQL:
         - create the user and the db
           su - postgres (or whatever is the db admin)
           createuser -P -S -D -R -l openupload 
           createdb --owner=openupload openupload "OpenUpload DB"
         - import the database schema and default config options
           psql -h 127.0.0.1 -W -U openupload -f sql/pgsql/1_structure.sql
           psql -h 127.0.0.1 -W -U openupload -f sql/pgsql/2_base.sql
         - import the configuration mode (it is not required):
           psql -h 127.0.0.1 -W -U openupload -f sql/pgsql/3_mode_<selected>.sql
       FLAT FILE (TXT):
         - the txt is usable, but I would not suggest it unless it's a really low traffic site.
         - make sure the "rootdir" for the txtdb folder is writable by your apache user
         - copy the default files from sql/txt/*.txt to the "rootdir" folder
         - substitute the wanted mode configuration txt/modes/acl_<mode>.txt over the acl.txt

    * Point your browser to http://localhost/<wherever>
    * Login with Username: admin Password: admin
    * Go to Profile and change your admin e-mail and password
    * Enjoy! :)

             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODES AND RIGHTS

    Application can be configured to achive different behavier depending on group rights.
    It comes with a set of predefined rights so that it enables/disables features.
    Mainly I think this are the most usefull modes one should require, but you are free to adapt 
    them after installation.

     * Public
       The site is completely public. No need for the user to login or register. It can upload and 
       download as it wishes. Still plugin limitations may apply.

     * Service
       The site is public for not registered users, but registered ones get more functionality (i.e. 
       less limitations, they can password protect the file, can send e-mails, etc).

     * Restricted
       The users to be able to upload need to register/login
       The download is still public.

     * Private
       The users must login to upload and they are not able to register (the Admin adds the users).
       The download is still available.
       I think this is the best solution for a company or user which wants internal users to upload
       files, but i.e. customers to download them freely.
       IMHO this is the best configuration in conjunction with LDAP/AD Authentication.

     * Internal use (which I do not provide, but might be needed)
       This is a mode which could be used for some people, but unless needed you will need to 
       configure the rights yourself.
       Mainly upload and download need a user to login.

    Basically the rights are checked with this priority:

    group / module / action
    group / module / *
    group / *      / *
    *     / module / action
    *     / module / *
    *     / *      / *

    where * stands for any value.

    With the LDAP authentication backend a user can be part of multiple groups.
    The check is done for every group the user is part of, and if none of it are matched
    the result is to deny the operation. (See LDAP AUTHENTICATION)

    NOTE: Be carfull with rights as you might block yourself out

    Also the plugins can be enabled and disabled based on the group a user is registered.
    Probabaly you'll need to adapt it to suit your needs.
    Plugins must be enabled / disabled on a group basis (this might change in the future),
    there is no * for the group.

             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LDAP AUTHENTICATION

    LDAP support is maily a company feature, where you want your internal users to be able to upload files,
    and Customers to be able to download (without the need to login).

    Supported (tested) infrastructures:
      - Openldap (I test it against a Samba3 + Openldap structure).
      - Active Directory (against a windows 2003 domain)

    LDAP configuration can be quite triky so you'll need to undersand what the configuration options are:
      - host       : this is easy, the host to ask login requests (your LDAP / AD server)
      - type       : in case of Active Directory put 'AD' as value
      - user       : this is the user used to do LDAP/AD queries. I'd suggest to create a readonly user.
      - password   : the "readonly" user password
      - domain     : only for Active Directory, specifies the AD domain (i.e. yourdomain.local), it's used 
                     for user authentication. (like User@yourdomain.local)
      - basedn     : this is the LDAP base DN
      - userdn     : the base dn for user searches. For LDAP it is also used for user authentication values 
                     (i.e. uid=User,ou=Users,dc=yourdomain,dc=local), it's the ou=Users,dc=yourdomain,dc=local
      - userckass  : the objectClass associated to the users (leave user for AD)
      - uid        : the field that corresponds to the user login (could be cn, i.e. cn=admin,ou=Users,... )
      - userfields : the list of correspondences between LDAP/AD attributes and the user fields
                     place particular attention to the group_id match, as it needs to match the main gid for 
                     group name search.
      - groupdn    : Group base search path. Where groups are stored (could be the same as basedn)
      - groupclass : The objectClass of a group (leave group for AD)
      - gid        : this is the value to be matched between the group_id in the user fields and the group)
      - groupfields: this is a list of correspondence between LDAP/AD group attributes and the group fields
      - sgid       : Mainly needed for Openldap, the user might be part of other groups. this is the lookup 
                     field for the login name to be a member of a group (not needed in AD)
      - sgidfields : correpondence between ldap sub group attributes and group attributes (mainly it's the 
                     same as groupfields) maybe I'll remove it, if I find out it's not needed.

    Once you have configured this part you should make sure to be able to login as administrator and change rights.
    It's probably a good idea to add a record with the Administrator group to be able to access anything.

    I'd suggest to create a set of dedicated groups for the application (i.e. OpenUploadAdmin, OpenUploadUser), 
    in your LDAP/AD configuration, and manage rights for only this groups (obviously assign to them the 
    users you want to access the service)
    Also I'm not really sure how it works if a user has more than 1 group with different rights (especially 
    on plugins)

    If it's a simple company you can use the default "Domain Users" and "Domain Admins".

    Please note that if LDAP is enabled you won't be able to manage users/groups from the Administration interface 
    (use the LDAP/AD for this)

    I'd also suggest to assign your users an e-mail addess.

             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MULTISITE INSTALLATION

    In the QUICK START you find out how to test the application.
    For a better installation this are my suggestions:

    Put the program somewhere which is not WEB accessible. (i.e. /usr/share/openupload)
    You can then copy the www folder to the WEB server root (or subdirectory), or even better,
    point the web server to the www folder if it's a single site configuration.

    Make sure the "data", "data/tmp" and "templates_c" folders are writable by the web user.

    Change the config.inc.php accordingly to your installation.

    If you want a multisite be sure to have a different config.inc.php per site (and db or db prefix).
    Create a template folder for every site (or maybe just 1 if you plan on changing only the logo).

             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IP BLOCKING FEATURE (actually allow/deny)

    The IP blocking feature is pretty configurable, so you can allow only a set of specific networks
    to access the site (i.e. VPN networks).
    The ip can be specified with a subnet mask (i.e. 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) or with a subnet mask 
    number (i.e. 192.168.1.0/23)

    Then you can decide wether this range accesses the site or not.
    So you could block an entire range of IPs with only one line.

    You can also secify a priority so let's say you want all the 192.168.0.0/16 networks to access,
    but you want to block the specific 192.168.99.0/24 network.

        IP          | ACCESS  | PRIORITY
    192.168.0.0/16  | allow   |  8
    192.168.99.0/24 | deny    |  7

    The IP Banning feature will set a default value of 10 as the priority rule for the IP to be BANNED.

    If you want to be sure that your network is not banned use a priority lower than that.

    Please be carefull as you could lock yourself out :)

             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLUGINS
  The provided plugins need to be enabled on a group basis.
  Some are feature plugins, others are limitation plugins.
  
  captcha  : allows the user to select a captcha before the download. (Requires GD extension)
  email    : allows sending e-mails with the download detail
  password : allows password protection of the download
  expire   : defines when an upload must expire (use the maintainance to delete them)
  filesize : definition of different file size uploads on a group basis
  mimetype : specify a limited set of mimetypes or ban some of them
  compress : allows to compress the uploaded files into an archive. Requires external tools
             (must be configured)

TEMPLATES / LOGO CHANGES (Notes)

    If you want to change something in the templates I'd suggest to create a site template and put 
    there the needed changed files,
    (templates/<yourtemplate> or www/templates/<yourtemplate>).
    The program will check for the exsistence of a file in the selected template folder, and if not 
    found will go back to the default.
    This will avoid problems when updating the program to a new version.
